<p>Kanidm is an identity management server, acting as an authority on accounts and authorisation
within a technical environment.</p>
<p>The intent of the Kanidm project is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide a single truth source for accounts, groups and privileges.</li>
<li>Enable integrations to systems and services so they can authenticate accounts.</li>
<li>Make system, network, application and web authentication easy and accessible.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTICE:</strong>
This is a pre-release project. While all effort has been made to ensure no data loss
or security flaws, you should still be careful when using this in your environment.</p>

<p>Whether you work in a business, a volunteer organisation, or are an enthusiast who manages 
their personal services, we need methods of authenticating and identifying ourselves
to these systems and subsequently, ways to determine what authorisation and privileges we have
while accessing these systems.</p>
<p>We've probably all been in workplaces where you end up with multiple accounts on various
systems - one for a workstation, different SSH keys for different tasks, maybe some shared
account passwords. Not only is it difficult for people to manage all these different credentials
and what they have access to, but it also means that sometimes these credentials have more
access or privilege than they require.</p>
<p>Kanidm acts as a central authority of accounts in your organisation and allows each account to associate
many devices and credentials with different privileges. An example of how this looks:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>A key design goal is that you authenticate with your device in some manner, and then your device will
continue to authenticate you in the future. Each of these different types of credential from SSH keys,
application passwords, RADIUS passwords and others, are &quot;things your device knows&quot;. Each password
has limited capability, and can only access that exact service or resource.</p>
<p>This helps improve security; a compromise of the service or the network transmission does not
grant you unlimited access to your account and all its privileges. As the credentials are specific
to a device, if a device is compromised you can revoke its associated credentials. If a
specific service is compromised, only the credentials for that service need to be revoked.</p>
<p>Due to this model, and the design of Kanidm to centre the device and to have more per-service credentials,
workflows and automation are added or designed to reduce human handling. An example of this
is the use of QR codes with deployment profiles to automatically enrol wireless credentials.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong> Our preferred deployment method is in containers, the documentation assumes you're running in docker. Kanidm will run in traditional compute, and server builds are available for multiple platforms or you can build the binaries yourself.</p>

<p>Currently we have docker images for the server components. They can be found at:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/kanidm/server">https://hub.docker.com/r/kanidm/server</a></li>
<li><a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/kanidm/radius">https://hub.docker.com/r/kanidm/radius</a></li>

<p>Kanidm ships with a secure-by-default configuration, however that is only as strong
as the platform that Kanidm operates in. This could be your container environment
or your Unix-like system.</p>
<p>This chapter will detail a number of warnings and security practices you should
follow to ensure that Kanidm operates in a secure environment.</p>
<p>The main server is a high-value target for a potential attack, as Kanidm serves as
the authority on identity and authorisation in a network. Compromise of the Kanidm
server is equivalent to a full-network take over, AKA &quot;game over&quot;.</p>
<p>The unixd resolver is also a high value target as it can be accessed to allow unauthorised
access to a server, to intercept communications to the server, or more. This also must be protected
carfully.</p>
<p>For this reason, Kanidm's components must be protected carefully. Kanidm avoids many classic
attacks by being developed in a memory safe language, but risks still exist.</p>
<h2 id="startup-warnings"><a class="header" href="#startup-warnings">Startup Warnings</a></h2>
<p>At startup Kanidm will warn you if the environment it is running in is suspicious or
has risks. For example:</p>
<pre><code>kanidmd server -c /tmp/server.toml
WARNING: permissions on /tmp/server.toml may not be secure. Should be readonly to running uid. This could be a security risk ...
WARNING: /tmp/server.toml has 'everyone' permission bits in the mode. This could be a security risk ...
WARNING: /tmp/server.toml owned by the current uid, which may allow file permission changes. This could be a security risk ...
WARNING: permissions on ../insecure/ca.pem may not be secure. Should be readonly to running uid. This could be a security risk ...
WARNING: permissions on ../insecure/cert.pem may not be secure. Should be readonly to running uid. This could be a security risk ...
WARNING: permissions on ../insecure/key.pem may not be secure. Should be readonly to running uid. This could be a security risk ...
WARNING: ../insecure/key.pem has 'everyone' permission bits in the mode. This could be a security risk ...
WARNING: DB folder /tmp has 'everyone' permission bits in the mode. This could be a security risk ...
</code></pre>
<p>Each warning highlights an issue that may exist in your environment. It is not possible for us to
prescribe an exact configuration that may secure your system. This is why we only present
possible risks.</p>
<h3 id="should-be-readonly-to-running-uid"><a class="header" href="#should-be-readonly-to-running-uid">Should be readonly to running uid</a></h3>
<p>Files such as configurations should be readonly to this UID/GID. This is so that if an attacker is
able to gain code execution, they are unable to modify the configuration to write or over-write
files in other locations, or to tamper with the systems configuration.</p>
<p>This can be prevented by changing the files ownership to another user, or removing &quot;write&quot; bits
from the group.</p>
<h3 id="everyone-permission-bits-in-the-mode"><a class="header" href="#everyone-permission-bits-in-the-mode">'everyone' permission bits in the mode</a></h3>
<p>This means that given a permission mask, &quot;everyone&quot; or all users of the system can read, write or
execute the content of this file. This may mean that if an account on the system is compromised the
attacker can read Kanidm content and may be able to further attack the system as a result.</p>
<p>This can be prevented by removed everyone execute bits from parent directories containing the
configuration, and removing everyone bits from the files in question.</p>
<h3 id="owned-by-the-current-uid-which-may-allow-file-permission-changes"><a class="header" href="#owned-by-the-current-uid-which-may-allow-file-permission-changes">owned by the current uid, which may allow file permission changes</a></h3>
<p>File permissions in unix systems are a discrestionary access control system, which means the
named uid owner is able to further modify the access of a file regardless of the current
settings. For example:</p>
<pre><code>[william@amethyst 12:25] /tmp &gt; touch test
[william@amethyst 12:25] /tmp &gt; ls -al test
-rw-r--r--  1 william  wheel  0 29 Jul 12:25 test
[william@amethyst 12:25] /tmp &gt; chmod 400 test
[william@amethyst 12:25] /tmp &gt; ls -al test
-r--------  1 william  wheel  0 29 Jul 12:25 test
[william@amethyst 12:25] /tmp &gt; chmod 644 test
[william@amethyst 12:26] /tmp &gt; ls -al test
-rw-r--r--  1 william  wheel  0 29 Jul 12:25 test
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that even though the file was set to &quot;read only&quot; to william, and no permission to any
other users, that as &quot;william&quot; I can change the bits to add write permissions back or permissions
for other users.</p>
<p>This can be prevent by making the file owner a different UID to the running process for kanidm.</p>
<h3 id="a-secure-example"><a class="header" href="#a-secure-example">A secure example</a></h3>
<p>Between these three issues it can be hard to see a possible strategy to secure files, however
one way exists - group read permissions. The most effective method to secure resources for kanidm
is to set configurations to:</p>
<pre><code>[william@amethyst 12:26] /etc/kanidm &gt; ls -al server.toml
-r--r-----   1 root           kanidm      212 28 Jul 16:53 server.toml
</code></pre>
<p>The kanidm server should be run as &quot;kanidm:kanidm&quot; with the appropriate user and user private
group created on your system. This applies to unixd configuration as well.</p>
<p>For the database your data folder should be:</p>
<pre><code>[root@amethyst 12:38] /data/kanidm &gt; ls -al .
total 1064
drwxrwx---   3 root     kanidm      96 29 Jul 12:38 .
-rw-r-----   1 kanidm   kanidm  544768 29 Jul 12:38 kanidm.db
</code></pre>
<p>IE this means 770 root:kanidm. This allows kanidm to create new files in the folder, but prevents
kanidm being able to change the permissions of the folder. Because the folder does not have
everyone mode bits, the content of the database is secure because users can now cd/read
from the directory.</p>
<p>Configurations for clients such as /etc/kanidm/config should be secured with the permissions
as:</p>
<pre><code>[william@amethyst 12:26] /etc/kanidm &gt; ls -al config
-r--r--r--    1 root  wheel    38 10 Jul 10:10 config
</code></pre>
<p>This file should be everyone-readable which is why the bits are defined as such.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: Why do you use 440 or 444 modes?</p>
<p>A bug exists in the implementation of readonly() in rust that checks this as &quot;does a write
bit exist for any user&quot; vs &quot;can the current uid write the file?&quot;. This distinction is subtle
but it affects the check. We don't believe this is a significant issue though because
setting these to 440 and 444 helps to prevent accidental changes by an administrator anyway</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="running-as-non-root-in-docker"><a class="header" href="#running-as-non-root-in-docker">Running as non-root in docker</a></h2>
<p>The commands provided in this book will run kanidmd as &quot;root&quot; in the container to make the onboarding
smoother. However, this is not recommended in production for security reasons.</p>
<p>You should allocate a uidnumber/gidnumber for the service to run as that is unique on your host
system. In this example we use <code>1000:1000</code></p>
<p>You will need to adjust the permissions on the <code>/data</code> volume to ensure that the process
can manage the files. Kanidm requires the ability to write to the <code>/data</code> directory to create
the sqlite files. This uid/gidnumber should match the above. You could consider the following
changes to help isolate these changes:</p>
<pre><code>docker run --rm -i -t -v kanidmd:/data opensuse/leap:latest /bin/sh
# mkdir /data/db/
# chown 1000:1000 /data/db/
# chmod 750 /data/db/
# sed -i -e &quot;s/db_path.*/db_path = \&quot;\/data\/db\/kanidm.db\&quot;/g&quot; /data/server.toml
# chown root:root /data/server.toml
# chmod 644 /data/server.toml
</code></pre>
<p>You can then use this with run the kanidm server in docker with a user.</p>
<pre><code>docker run --rm -i -t -u 1000:1000 -v kanidmd:/data kanidm/server:latest /sbin/kanidmd ...
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>HINT</strong>
You need to use the uidnumber/gidnumber to the <code>-u</code> argument, as the container can't resolve
usernames from the host system.</p>

<p>Once complete, you can use <code>kanidm</code> without reauthenticating for a period of time for administration.</p>
<p>You can list active sessions with:</p>
<pre><code>kanidm session list

from identity administration actions. An idm_admin is also provided that is only for management
of accounts and groups.</p>
<p>Both admin and idm_admin should <em>NOT</em> be used for daily activities - they exist for initial
system configuration, and for disaster recovery scenarios. You should delegate permissions
as required to named user accounts instead.</p>
<p>The majority of the provided content is privilege groups that provide rights over Kanidm
administrative actions. These include groups for account management, person management (personal
and sensitive data), group management, and more.</p>
<h2 id="recovering-the-initial-idm_admin-account"><a class="header" href="#recovering-the-initial-idm_admin-account">Recovering the Initial idm_admin Account</a></h2>
<p>By default the idm_admin has no password, and can not be accessed. You should recover it with the
admin (system admin) account. We recommend the use of &quot;reset_credential&quot; as it provides a high
strength, random, machine only password.</p>
<pre><code>kanidm account credential reset_credential  --name admin idm_admin
Generated password for idm_admin: tqoReZfz....
</code></pre>
<h2 id="creating-accounts"><a class="header" href="#creating-accounts">Creating Accounts</a></h2>
<p>We can now use the idm_admin to create initial groups and accounts.</p>
<pre><code>kanidm group create demo_group --name idm_admin
kanidm account create demo_user &quot;Demonstration User&quot; --name idm_admin
kanidm group add_members demo_group demo_user --name idm_admin
kanidm group list_members demo_group --name idm_admin
kanidm account get demo_user --name idm_admin
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use anonymous to view users and groups - note that you won't see as many fields due
to the different anonymous access profile limits!</p>
<pre><code>kanidm account get demo_user --name anonymous
</code></pre>
<h2 id="viewing-default-groups"><a class="header" href="#viewing-default-groups">Viewing Default Groups</a></h2>
<p>You should take some time to inspect the default groups which are related to
default permissions. These can be viewed with:</p>
<pre><code>kanidm group list
kanidm group get &lt;name&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="resetting-account-credentials"><a class="header" href="#resetting-account-credentials">Resetting Account Credentials</a></h2>
<p>Members of the <code>idm_account_manage_priv</code> group have the rights to manage other users
accounts security and login aspects. This includes resetting account credentials.</p>
<p>We can perform a password reset on the demo_user for example as idm_admin, who is
a default member of this group.</p>
<pre><code>kanidm account credential set_password demo_user --name idm_admin
kanidm self whoami --name demo_user
</code></pre>
<h2 id="nested-groups"><a class="header" href="#nested-groups">Nested Groups</a></h2>
<p>Kanidm supports groups being members of groups, allowing nested groups. These nesting relationships
are shown through the &quot;memberof&quot; attribute on groups and accounts.</p>
<p>Kanidm makes all group-membership determinations by inspecting an entries &quot;memberof&quot; attribute.</p>
<p>An example can be easily shown with:</p>
<pre><code>kanidm group create group_1 --name idm_admin
kanidm group create group_2 --name idm_admin
kanidm account create nest_example &quot;Nesting Account Example&quot; --name idm_admin
kanidm group add_members group_1 group_2 --name idm_admin
kanidm group add_members group2 nest_example --name idm_admin
kanidm account get nest_example --name anonymous
</code></pre>
<h2 id="account-validity"><a class="header" href="#account-validity">Account Validity</a></h2>
<p>Kanidm supports accounts that are only able to be authenticated between specific datetime
windows. This takes the form of a &quot;valid from&quot; attribute that defines the earliest start
date where authentication can succeed, and an expiry date where the account will no longer
allow authentication.</p>
<p>This can be displayed with:</p>
<pre><code>kanidm account validity show demo_user --name idm_admin
valid after: 2020-09-25T21:22:04+10:00
expire: 2020-09-25T01:22:04+10:00
</code></pre>
<p>These datetimes are stored in the server as UTC, but presented according to your local system time
to aid correct understanding of when the events will occur.</p>
<p>To set the values, an account with account management permission is required (for example, idm_admin).
Again, these values will correctly translated from the entered local timezone to UTC.</p>
<pre><code># Set the earliest time the account can start authenticating
kanidm account validity begin_from demo_user '2020-09-25T11:22:04+00:00' --name idm_admin
# Set the expiry or end date of the account
kanidm account validity expire_at demo_user '2020-09-25T11:22:04+00:00' --name idm_admin
</code></pre>
<p>To unset or remove these values the following can be used:</p>
<pre><code>kanidm account validity begin_from demo_user any|clear --name idm_admin
kanidm account validity expire_at demo_user never|clear --name idm_admin
</code></pre>
<p>To &quot;lock&quot; an account, you can set the expire_at value to the past or unix epoch. Even in the situation
where the &quot;valid from&quot; is <em>after</em> the expire_at, the expire_at will be respected.</p>
<pre><code>kanidm account validity expire_at demo_user 1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00 --name idm_admin
</code></pre>
<p>These validity settings impact all authentication functions of the account (kanidm, ldap, radius).</p>
<h2 id="why-cant-i-change-admin-with-idm_admin"><a class="header" href="#why-cant-i-change-admin-with-idm_admin">Why Can't I Change admin With idm_admin?</a></h2>
<p>As a security mechanism there is a distinction between &quot;accounts&quot; and &quot;high permission
accounts&quot;. This is to help prevent elevation attacks, where say a member of a
service desk could attempt to reset the password of idm_admin or admin, or even a member of
HR or System Admin teams to move laterally.</p>
<p>Generally, membership of a &quot;privilege&quot; group that ships with Kanidm, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>idm_account_manage_priv</li>
<li>idm_people_read_priv</li>
<li>idm_schema_manage_priv</li>
<li>many more ...</li>
</ul>
<p>Indirectly grants you membership to &quot;idm_high_privilege&quot;. If you are a member of
this group, the standard &quot;account&quot; and &quot;people&quot; rights groups are NOT able to
alter, read or manage these accounts. To manage these accounts higher rights
are required, such as those held by the admin account are required.</p>
<p>Further, groups that are considered &quot;idm_high_privilege&quot; can NOT be managed
by the standard &quot;idm_group_manage_priv&quot; group.</p>
<p>Management of high privilege accounts and groups is granted through the
the &quot;hp&quot; variants of all privileges. A non-conclusive list:</p>
<ul>
<li>idm_hp_account_read_priv</li>
<li>idm_hp_account_manage_priv</li>
<li>idm_hp_account_write_priv</li>
<li>idm_hp_group_manage_priv</li>
<li>idm_hp_group_write_priv</li>
</ul>
<p>Membership of any of these groups should be considered to be equivalent to
system administration rights in the directory, and by extension, over all network
resources that trust Kanidm.</p>
<p>All groups that are flagged as &quot;idm_high_privilege&quot; should be audited and
monitored to ensure that they are not altered.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="administration-tasks"><a class="header" href="#administration-tasks">Administration Tasks</a></h1>
<p>There are a number of tasks that you may wish to perform as an administrator of a service like Kanidm.</p>
<h1 id="backup-and-restore"><a class="header" href="#backup-and-restore">Backup and Restore</a></h1>
<p>With any idm software, it's important you have the capability to restore in case of a disaster - be
that physical damage or mistake. Kanidm supports backup and restore of the database with two methods.</p>
<h2 id="method-1"><a class="header" href="#method-1">Method 1</a></h2>
<p>Method 1 involves taking a backup of the database entry content, which is then re-indexed on restore.
This is the preferred method.</p>
<p>To take the backup (assuming our docker environment) you first need to stop the instance:</p>
<pre><code>docker stop &lt;container name&gt;
docker run --rm -i -t -v kanidmd:/data -v kanidmd_backups:/backup \
    kanidm/server:latest /sbin/kanidmd backup -c /data/server.toml \
    /backup/kanidm.backup.json
docker start &lt;container name&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>You can then restart your instance. DO NOT modify the backup.json as it may introduce
data errors into your instance.</p>
<p>To restore from the backup:</p>
<pre><code>docker stop &lt;container name&gt;
docker run --rm -i -t -v kanidmd:/data -v kanidmd_backups:/backup \
    kanidm/server:latest /sbin/kanidmd restore -c /data/server.toml \
    /backup/kanidm.backup.json
docker start &lt;container name&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>That's it!</p>
<h2 id="method-2"><a class="header" href="#method-2">Method 2</a></h2>
<p>This is a simple backup of the data volume.</p>
<pre><code>docker stop &lt;container name&gt;
# Backup your docker's volume folder
docker start &lt;container name&gt;
</code></pre>
<h1 id="rename-the-domain"><a class="header" href="#rename-the-domain">Rename the domain</a></h1>
<p>There are some cases where you may need to rename the domain. You should have configured
this initially in the setup, however you may have a situation where a business is changing
name, merging, or other needs which may prompt this needing to be changed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> This WILL break ALL u2f/webauthn tokens that have been enrolled, which MAY cause
accounts to be locked out and unrecoverable until further action is taken. DO NOT CHANGE
the <code>domain_name</code> unless REQUIRED and have a plan on how to manage these issues.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> This operation can take an extensive amount of time as ALL accounts and groups
in the domain MUST have their SPN's regenerated. This will also cause a large delay in
replication once the system is restarted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You should take a backup before proceeding with this operation.</p>
<p>When you have a created a migration plan and strategy on handling the invalidation of webauthn,
you can then rename the domain with the commands as follows:</p>
<pre><code>docker stop &lt;container name&gt;
docker run --rm -i -t -v kandimd:/data \
    kanidm/server:latest /sbin/kanidmd domain_name_change -c /data/server.toml \
    -n idm.new.domain.name
docker start &lt;container name&gt;
</code></pre>
<h1 id="reindexing-after-schema-extension"><a class="header" href="#reindexing-after-schema-extension">Reindexing after schema extension</a></h1>
<p>In some (rare) cases you may need to reindex.
Please note the server will sometimes reindex on startup as a result of the project
changing its internal schema definitions. This is normal and expected - you may never need
to start a reindex yourself as a result!</p>
<p>You'll likely notice a need to reindex if you add indexes to schema and you see a message in your logs such as:</p>
<pre><code>Index EQUALITY name not found
Index {type} {attribute} not found
</code></pre>
<p>This indicates that an index of type equality has been added for name, but the indexing process
has not been run. The server will continue to operate and the query execution code will correctly
process the query - however it will not be the optimal method of delivering the results as we need to
disregard this part of the query and act as though it's un-indexed.</p>
<p>Reindexing will resolve this by forcing all indexes to be recreated based on their schema
definitions (this works even though the schema is in the same database!)</p>
<pre><code>docker stop &lt;container name&gt;
docker run --rm -i -t -v kanidmd:/data \
    kanidm/server:latest /sbin/kanidmd reindex -c /data/server.toml
docker start &lt;container name&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Generally, reindexing is a rare action and should not normally be required.</p>
<h1 id="vacuum"><a class="header" href="#vacuum">Vacuum</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://www.sqlite.org/lang_vacuum.html">Vacuuming</a> is the process of reclaiming un-used pages 
from the sqlite freelists, as well as performing some data reordering tasks that may make some 
queries more efficient . It is recommended that you vacuum after a reindex is performed or 
when you wish to reclaim space in the database file.</p>
<p>Vacuum is also able to change the pagesize of the database. After changing db_fs_type (which affects 
pagesize) in server.toml, you must run a vacuum for this to take effect.</p>
<pre><code>docker stop &lt;container name&gt;
docker run --rm -i -t -v kanidmd:/data \
    kanidm/server:latest /sbin/kanidmd vacuum -c /data/server.toml
docker start &lt;container name&gt;
</code></pre>
<h1 id="verification"><a class="header" href="#verification">Verification</a></h1>
<p>The server ships with a number of verification utilities to ensure that data is consistent such
as referential integrity or memberof.</p>
<p>Note that verification really is a last resort - the server does <em>a lot</em> to prevent and self-heal
from errors at run time, so you should rarely if ever require this utility. This utility was
developed to guarantee consistency during development!</p>
<p>You can run a verification with:</p>
<pre><code>docker stop &lt;container name&gt;
docker run --rm -i -t -v kanidmd:/data \
    kanidm/server:latest /sbin/kanidmd verify -c /data/server.toml
docker start &lt;container name&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>If you have errors, please contact the project to help support you to resolve these.</p>
<h1 id="raw-actions"><a class="header" href="#raw-actions">Raw actions</a></h1>
<p>The server has a low-level stateful API you can use for more complex or advanced tasks on large numbers
of entries at once. Some examples are below, but generally we advise you to use the APIs as listed
above.</p>
<pre><code># Create from json (group or account)
kanidm raw create -H https://localhost:8443 -C ../insecure/ca.pem -D admin example.create.account.json

<p>Kanidm embeds a set of tools to help your users use and create strong passwords. This is important as not all user types will require MFA for their roles, but compromised accounts still pose a risk. There may also be deployment or other barriers to a site rolling out site wide MFA.</p>
<h2 id="quality-checking"><a class="header" href="#quality-checking">Quality Checking</a></h2>
<p>Kanidm enforces that all passwords are checked by the library &quot;<a href="https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn">zxcvbn</a>&quot;. This has a large number of checks for password quality. It also provides constructive feedback to users on how to improve their passwords if it was rejected.</p>
<p>Some things that zxcvbn looks for is use of the account name or email in the password, common passwords, low entropy passwords, dates, reverse words and more.</p>
<p>This library can not be disabled - all passwords in Kanidm must pass this check.</p>
<h2 id="password-badlisting"><a class="header" href="#password-badlisting">Password Badlisting</a></h2>
<p>This is the process of configuring a list of passwords to exclude from being able to be used. This is especially useful if a specific business has been notified of a compromised account, allowing you to maintain a list of customised excluded passwords.</p>
<p>The other value to this feature is being able to badlist common passwords that zxcvbn does not detect, or from other large scale password compromises.</p>
<p>By default we ship with a preconfigured badlist that is updated overtime as new password breach lists are made available.</p>
<h2 id="updating-your-own-badlist"><a class="header" href="#updating-your-own-badlist">Updating your own badlist.</a></h2>
<p>You can update your own badlist by using the proided <code>kanidm_badlist_preprocess</code> tool which helps to automate this process.</p>
<p>Given a list of passwords in a text file, it will generate a modification set which can be applied. The tool also provides the command you need to run to apply this.</p>
<pre><code>kanidm_badlist_preprocess -m -o /tmp/modlist.json &lt;password file&gt; [&lt;password file&gt; &lt;password file&gt; ...]

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="posix-accounts-and-groups"><a class="header" href="#posix-accounts-and-groups">POSIX Accounts and Groups</a></h1>
<p>Kanidm has features that enable its accounts and groups to be consumed on
POSIX-like machines, such as Linux, FreeBSD, or others.</p>
<h2 id="notes-on-posix-features"><a class="header" href="#notes-on-posix-features">Notes on POSIX Features</a></h2>
<p>Many design decisions have been made in the POSIX features
of kanidm that are intended to make distributed systems easier to manage and
client systems more secure.</p>
<h3 id="uid-and-gid-numbers"><a class="header" href="#uid-and-gid-numbers">UID and GID numbers</a></h3>
<p>In Kanidm there is no difference between a UID and a GID number. On most UNIX systems
a user will create all files with a primary user and group. The primary group is
effectively equivalent to the permissions of the user. It is very easy to see scenarios
where someone may change the account to have a shared primary group (ie <code>allusers</code>),
but without changing the umask on all client systems. This can cause users' data to be
compromised by any member of the same shared group.</p>
<p>To prevent this, many systems create a &quot;user private group&quot;, or UPG. This group has the
gidnumber matching the uidnumber of the user, and the user sets its primary
group id to the gidnumber of the UPG.</p>
<p>As there is now an equivalence between the UID and GID number of the user and the UPG,
there is no benefit to separating these values. As a result kanidm accounts <em>only</em>
have a gidnumber, which is also considered to be its uidnumber as well. This has the benefit
of preventing the accidental creation of a separate group that has an overlapping gidnumber
(the <code>uniqueness</code> attribute of the schema will block the creation).</p>
<h3 id="upg-generation"><a class="header" href="#upg-generation">UPG generation</a></h3>
<p>Due to the requirement that a user have a UPG for security, many systems create these as
two independent items. For example in /etc/passwd and /etc/group</p>
<pre><code># passwd
william:x:654401105:654401105::/home/william:/bin/zsh
# group
william:x:654401105:
</code></pre>
<p>Other systems like FreeIPA use a plugin that generates a UPG as a database record on
creation of the account.</p>
<p>Kanidm does neither of these. As the gidnumber of the user must be unique, and a user
implies the UPG must exist, we can generate UPG's on-demand from the account.
This has a single side effect - that you are unable to add any members to a
UPG - given the nature of a user private group, this is the point.</p>
<h3 id="gidnumber-generation"><a class="header" href="#gidnumber-generation">gidnumber generation</a></h3>
<p>In the future, Kanidm plans to have asynchronous replication as a feature between writable
database servers. In this case, we need to be able to allocate stable and reliable
gidnumbers to accounts on replicas that may not be in continual communication.</p>
<p>To do this, we use the last 32 bits of the account or group's UUID to generate the
gidnumber.</p>
<p>A valid concern is the possibility of duplication in the lower 32 bits. Given the
birthday problem, if you have 77,000 groups and accounts, you have a 50% chance
of duplication. With 50,000 you have a 20% chance, 9,300 you have a 1% chance and
with 2900 you have a 0.1% chance.</p>
<p>We advise that if you have a site with &gt;10,000 users you should use an external system 
to allocate gidnumbers serially or consistently to avoid potential duplication events.</p>
<p>This design decision is made as most small sites will benefit greatly from the
autoallocation policy and the simplicity of its design, while larger enterprises
will already have IDM or Business process applications for HR/People that are
capable of supplying this kind of data in batch jobs.</p>

some other interruption occurs.</p>
<p>The kanidm_ssh_authorizedkeys command is part of the kanidm-unix-clients package, so should be installed
on the servers. It communicates to kanidm_unixd, so you should have a configured PAM/nsswitch

<p>The recycle bin is a storage of deleted entries from the server. This allows
recovery from mistakes for a period of time.</p>

not everything can be &quot;put back&quot; the way it was. Be sure to check your entries

<h2 id="where-is-the-recycle-bin"><a class="header" href="#where-is-the-recycle-bin">Where is the Recycle Bin?</a></h2>
<p>The recycle bin is stored as part of your main database - it is included in all

all servers.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-things-get-into-the-recycle-bin"><a class="header" href="#how-do-things-get-into-the-recycle-bin">How do things get into the Recycle Bin?</a></h2>
<p>Any delete operation of an entry will cause it to be sent to the recycle bin. No

<p>You can display all items in the Recycle Bin with:</p>

<h2 id="edge-cases"><a class="header" href="#edge-cases">Edge cases</a></h2>
<p>The recycle bin is a best effort to restore your data - there are some cases where
the revived entries may not be the same as their were when they were deleted. This
generally revolves around reference types such as group membership.</p>
<p>An example of this is the following steps:</p>
<pre><code>add user1
add group1
add user1 as member of group1
delete user1
delete group1
revive user1
revive group1
</code></pre>
<p>In this series of steps, due to the way that referential integrity is implemented, the
membership of user1 in group1 would be lost in this process. To explain why:</p>
<pre><code>add user1
add group1
add user1 as member of group1 // refint between the two established, and memberof added
delete user1 // group1 removes member user1 from refint
delete group1 // user1 now removes memberof group1 from refint
revive user1 // re-add groups based on directmemberof (empty set)
revive group1 // no members
</code></pre>
<p>This issue could be looked at again in the future, but for now we think that deletes of
groups is rare - we expect recycle bin to save you in &quot;opps&quot; moments, and in a majority
of cases you may delete a group or a user and then restore them. To handle this series
of steps requires extra code complexity in how we flag operations. For more,

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="ldap"><a class="header" href="#ldap">LDAP</a></h1>
<p>While many applications can support systems like SAML or OAuth, many do not. LDAP
has been the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of authentication for many years, with almost
every application in the world being able to search and bind to LDAP. As there
are still many of these in the world, Kanidm can host a read-only
LDAP interface.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong> The LDAP server in Kanidm is not RFC compliant. This
is intentional, as Kanidm wants to cover the common use case (simple bind and search).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-is-ldap"><a class="header" href="#what-is-ldap">What is LDAP</a></h2>
<p>LDAP is a protocol to read data from a directory of information. It is not
a server, but a way to communicate to a server. There are many famous LDAP
implementations such as Active Directory, 389 Directory Server, DSEE,
FreeIPA and many others. Because it is a standard, applications can use
an LDAP client library to authenticate users to LDAP, given &quot;one account&quot; for
many applications - an IDM just like Kanidm!</p>
<h2 id="data-mapping"><a class="header" href="#data-mapping">Data Mapping</a></h2>
<p>Kanidm is not able to be mapped 100% to LDAP's objects. This is because LDAP
types are simple key-values on objects which are all UTF8 strings (or subsets
thereof) based on validation (matching) rules. Kanidm internally implements complex
data types such as tagging on SSH keys, or multi-value credentials. These can not
be represented in LDAP.</p>
<p>As well many of the structures in Kanidm don't correlate closely to LDAP. For example
Kanidm only has a gidnumber, where LDAP's schema's define uidnumber and gidnumber.</p>
<p>Entries in the database also have a specific name in LDAP, related to their path
in the directory tree. Kanidm is a flat model, so we have to emulate some tree-like
elements, and ignore others.</p>
<p>For this reason, when you search the LDAP interface, Kanidm will make some mapping decisions.</p>
<ul>
<li>The domain_info object becomes the suffix root.</li>
<li>All other entries are direct subordinates of the domain_info for DN purposes</li>
<li>DN's are generated from the attributes naming attributes</li>
<li>Bind DN's can be remapped and rewritten, and may not even be a DN during bind.</li>
<li>The Kanidm domain name is used to generate the basedn.</li>
<li>The '*' and '+' operators can not be used in conjuction with attribute lists in searches.</li>
</ul>
<p>These decisions were made to make the path as simple and effective as possible,
relying more on the Kanidm query and filter system than attempting to generate a tree-like
representation of data. As almost all clients can use filters for entry selection
we don't believe this is a limitation for consuming applications.</p>
<h2 id="security"><a class="header" href="#security">Security</a></h2>
<h3 id="tls-2"><a class="header" href="#tls-2">TLS</a></h3>
<p>StartTLS is not supported due to security risks. LDAPS is the only secure method
of communicating to any LDAP server. Kanidm if configured with certificates will
use them for LDAPS (and will not listen on a plaintext LDAP port). If no certificates exist
Kanidm will listen on a plaintext LDAP port, and you MUST TLS terminate in front
of the Kanidm system to secure data and authentication.</p>
<h3 id="access-controls"><a class="header" href="#access-controls">Access Controls</a></h3>
<p>LDAP only supports password authentication. As LDAP is used heavily in posix environments
the LDAP bind for any DN will use its configured posix password.</p>
<p>As the posix password is not equivalent in strength to the primary credentials of Kanidm
(which may be MFA), the LDAP bind does not grant rights to elevated read permissions.
All binds have the permissions of &quot;Anonymous&quot; (even if the anonymous account is locked).</p>
<h2 id="server-configuration-1"><a class="header" href="#server-configuration-1">Server Configuration</a></h2>
<p>To configure Kanidm to provide LDAP you add the argument to the <code>server.toml</code> configuration:</p>
<pre><code>ldapbindaddress = &quot;127.0.0.1:3636&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>You should configure TLS certificates and keys as usual - LDAP will re-use the webserver TLS
material.</p>
<h2 id="showing-ldap-entries-and-attribute-maps"><a class="header" href="#showing-ldap-entries-and-attribute-maps">Showing LDAP entries and attribute maps</a></h2>
<p>By default Kanidm is limited in what attributes are generated or remaped into LDAP entries. However,
the server internally contains a map of extended attribute mappings for application specific requests
that must be satisfied.</p>
<p>An example is that some applications expect and require a 'CN' value, even though Kanidm does not
provide it. If the application is unable to be configured to accept &quot;name&quot; it may be necessary
to use Kanidm's mapping feature. Today these are compiled into the server so you may need to open
an issue with your requirements.</p>
<p>To show what attribute maps exists for an entry you can use the attribute search term '+'.</p>
<pre><code># To show Kanidm attributes
ldapsearch ... -x '(name=admin)' '*'
# To show all attribute maps
ldapsearch ... -x '(name=admin)' '+'
</code></pre>
<p>Attributes that are in the map, can be requested explicitly, and this can be combined with requesting
kanidm native attributes.</p>
<pre><code>ldapsearch ... -x '(name=admin)' cn objectClass displayname memberof
</code></pre>
<h2 id="example"><a class="header" href="#example">Example</a></h2>
<p>Given a default install with domain &quot;example.com&quot; the configured LDAP DN will be &quot;dc=example,dc=com&quot;.
This can be queried with:</p>
<pre><code>cargo run -- server -D kanidm.db -C ca.pem -c cert.pem -k key.pem -b 127.0.0.1:8443 -l 127.0.0.1:3636
&gt; LDAPTLS_CACERT=ca.pem ldapsearch -H ldaps://127.0.0.1:3636 -b 'dc=example,dc=com' -x '(name=test1)'

# test1@example.com, example.com
dn: spn=test1@example.com,dc=example,dc=com
objectclass: account
objectclass: memberof
objectclass: object
objectclass: person
displayname: Test User
memberof: spn=group240@example.com,dc=example,dc=com
name: test1
spn: test1@example.com
entryuuid: 22a65b6c-80c8-4e1a-9b76-3f3afdff8400
</code></pre>
<p>It is recommended that client applications filter accounts that can login with '(class=account)'
and groups with '(class=group)'. If possible, group membership is defined in rfc2307bis or
Active Directory style. This means groups are determined from the &quot;memberof&quot; attribute which contains
a DN to a group.</p>
<p>LDAP binds can use any unique identifier of the account. The following are all valid bind DN's for
the object listed above (if it was a posix account that is).</p>
<pre><code>ldapwhoami ... -x -D 'name=test1'
ldapwhoami ... -x -D 'spn=test1@example.com'
ldapwhoami ... -x -D 'test1@example.com'
ldapwhoami ... -x -D 'test1'
ldapwhoami ... -x -D '22a65b6c-80c8-4e1a-9b76-3f3afdff8400'
ldapwhoami ... -x -D 'spn=test1@example.com,dc=example,dc=com'
ldapwhoami ... -x -D 'name=test1,dc=example,dc=com'
</code></pre>
<p>Most LDAP clients are very picky about TLS, and can be very hard to debug or display errors. For example
these commands:</p>
<pre><code>ldapsearch -H ldaps://127.0.0.1:3636 -b 'dc=example,dc=com' -x '(name=test1)'
ldapsearch -H ldap://127.0.0.1:3636 -b 'dc=example,dc=com' -x '(name=test1)'
ldapsearch -H ldap://127.0.0.1:3389 -b 'dc=example,dc=com' -x '(name=test1)'
</code></pre>
<p>All give the same error:</p>
<pre><code>ldap_sasl_bind(SIMPLE): Can't contact LDAP server (-1)
</code></pre>
<p>This is despite the fact:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first command is a certificate validation error</li>
<li>The second is a missing LDAPS on a TLS port</li>
<li>The third is an incorrect port</li>
</ul>
<p>To diagnose errors like this, you may need to add &quot;-d 1&quot; to your LDAP commands or client.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="pam-and-nsswitch"><a class="header" href="#pam-and-nsswitch">PAM and nsswitch</a></h1>
<p><a href="http://linux-pam.org">PAM</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_Service_Switch">nsswitch</a> are the core mechanisms used by Linux and BSD clients to resolve identities from an IDM service like Kanidm into accounts that can be used on the machine for various interactive tasks.</p>
<h2 id="the-unix-daemon"><a class="header" href="#the-unix-daemon">The UNIX daemon</a></h2>
<p>Kanidm provides a UNIX daemon that runs on any client that wants to use PAM and nsswitch integration. This is provided as the daemon can cache the accounts for users who have unreliable networks or leave the site where Kanidm is. The cache is also able to cache missing-entry responses to reduce network traffic and main server load.</p>
<p>Additionally, the daemon means that the PAM and nsswitch integration libraries can be small, helping to reduce the attack surface of the machine. Similarly, a tasks daemon is available that can create home directories on first login and supports several features related to aliases and links to these home directories.</p>
<p>We recommend you install the client daemon from your system package manager.</p>
<pre><code># OpenSUSE
zypper in kanidm-unixd-clients
# Fedora
dnf install kanidm-unixd-clients
</code></pre>
<p>You can check the daemon is running on your Linux system with</p>
<pre><code>systemctl status kanidm-unixd
</code></pre>
<p>You can check the privileged tasks daemon is running with</p>
<pre><code>systemctl status kanidm-unixd-tasks
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> The <code>kanidm_unixd_tasks</code> daemon is not required for PAM and nsswitch functionality.
If disabled, your system will function as usual. It is however recommended due to the features
it provides supporting Kanidm's capabilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both unixd daemons use the connection configuration from /etc/kanidm/config. This is the covered in
<a href="./client_tools.html#kandim-configuration">client_tools</a>. </p>
<p>You can also configure some unixd specific options with the file /etc/kanidm/unixd.</p>
<pre><code>pam_allowed_login_groups = [&quot;posix_group&quot;]
default_shell = &quot;/bin/sh&quot;
home_prefix = &quot;/home/&quot;
home_attr = &quot;uuid&quot;
home_alias = &quot;spn&quot;
uid_attr_map = &quot;spn&quot;
gid_attr_map = &quot;spn&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>pam_allowed_login_groups</code> defines a set of posix groups where membership of any of these
groups will be allowed to login via PAM. All posix users and groups can be resolved by nss
regardless of PAM login status. This may be a group name, spn or uuid.</p>
<p><code>default_shell</code> is the default shell for users with none defined. Defaults to <code>/bin/sh</code>.</p>
<p><code>home_prefix</code> is the prepended path to where home directories are stored. Must end with
a trailing <code>/</code>. Defaults to <code>/home/</code>.</p>
<p><code>home_attr</code> is the default token attribute used for the home directory path. Valid
choices are <code>uuid</code>, <code>name</code>, <code>spn</code>. Defaults to <code>uuid</code>.</p>
<p><code>home_alias</code> is the default token attribute used for generating symlinks pointing to the users
home directory. If set, this will become the value of the home path
to nss calls. It is recommended you choose a &quot;human friendly&quot; attribute here.
Valid choices are <code>none</code>, <code>uuid</code>, <code>name</code>, <code>spn</code>. Defaults to <code>spn</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTICE:</strong>
All users in Kanidm can change their name (and their spn) at any time. If you change
<code>home_attr</code> from <code>uuid</code> you <em>must</em> have a plan on how to manage these directory renames
in your system. We recommend that you have a stable id (like the uuid) and symlinks
from the name to the uuid folder. Automatic support is provided for this via the unixd
tasks daemon, as documented here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>uid_attr_map</code> chooses which attribute is used for domain local users in presentation. Defaults
to <code>spn</code>. Users from a trust will always use spn.</p>
<p><code>gid_attr_map</code> chooses which attribute is used for domain local groups in presentation. Defaults
to <code>spn</code>. Groups from a trust will always use spn.</p>
<p>You can then check the communication status of the daemon as any user account.</p>
<pre><code>$ kanidm_unixd_status
</code></pre>
<p>If the daemon is working, you should see:</p>
<pre><code>[2020-02-14T05:58:37Z INFO  kanidm_unixd_status] working!
</code></pre>
<p>If it is not working, you will see an error message:</p>

<p>For more, see troubleshooting.</p>
<h2 id="nsswitch"><a class="header" href="#nsswitch">nsswitch</a></h2>
<p>When the daemon is running you can add the nsswitch libraries to /etc/nsswitch.conf</p>

<p>PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) is how a unix-like system allows users to authenticate

<p>There is an important distinction between these two - invalidated cache items may still
be yielded to a client request if the communication to the main Kanidm server is not

<p>Clearing the cache, however, completely wipes all local data about all accounts and groups.
If you are relying on this cached (but invalid data) you may lose access to your accounts until

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="radius"><a class="header" href="#radius">RADIUS</a></h1>
<p>RADIUS is a network protocol that is commonly used to allow wifi devices or
VPN's to authenticate users to a network boundary. While it should not be a
sole point of trust/authentication to an identity, it's still an important
control for improving barriers to attackers access to network resources.</p>
<p>Kanidm has a philosophy that each account can have multiple credentials which
are related to their devices and limited to specific resources. RADIUS is
no exception and has a separate credential for each account to use for
RADIUS access.</p>
<h2 id="disclaimer"><a class="header" href="#disclaimer">Disclaimer</a></h2>
<p>It's worth noting some disclaimers about Kanidm's RADIUS integration here</p>
<h3 id="one-credential---one-account"><a class="header" href="#one-credential---one-account">One Credential - One Account</a></h3>
<p>Kanidm normally attempts to have credentials for each <em>device</em> and <em>application</em>
rather than the legacy model of one to one.</p>
<p>The RADIUS protocol is only able to attest a <em>single</em> credential in an authentication
attempt, which limits us to storing a single RADIUS credential per account. However
despite this limitation, it still greatly improves the situation by isolating the
RADIUS credential from the primary or application credentials of the account. This
solves many common security concerns around credential loss or disclosure
and prevents rogue devices from locking out accounts as they attempt to
authenticate to wifi with expired credentials.</p>
<h3 id="cleartext-credential-storage"><a class="header" href="#cleartext-credential-storage">Cleartext Credential Storage</a></h3>
<p>RADIUS offers many different types of tunnels and authentication mechanisms.
However, most client devices &quot;out of the box&quot; only attempt a single type when you select 
a WPA2-Enterprise network: MSCHAPv2 with PEAP. This is a challenge-response protocol 
that requires cleartext or NTLM credentials.</p>
<p>As MSCHAPv2 with PEAP is the only practical, universal RADIUS type supported
on all devices with &quot;minimal&quot; configuration, we consider it imperative
that it MUST be supported as the default. Esoteric RADIUS types can be used
as well, but this is up to administrators to test and configure.</p>
<p>Due to this requirement, we must store the RADIUS material as cleartext or
NTLM hashes. It would be silly to think that NTLM is &quot;secure&quot; as it's md4
which is only an illusion of security.</p>
<p>This means Kanidm stores RADIUS credentials in the database as cleartext.</p>
<p>We believe this is a reasonable decision and is a low risk to security as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The access controls around RADIUS secrets by default are &quot;strong&quot;, limited
to only self-account read and RADIUS-server read.</li>
<li>As RADIUS credentials are separate from the primary account credentials and have 
no other rights, their disclosure is not going to lead to a full account compromise.</li>
<li>Having the credentials in cleartext allows a better user experience as clients 
can view the credentials at any time to enrol further devices.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="account-credential-configuration"><a class="header" href="#account-credential-configuration">Account Credential Configuration</a></h2>
<p>For an account to use RADIUS they must first generate a RADIUS secret unique to
that account. By default, all accounts can self-create this secret.</p>
<pre><code>kanidm account radius generate_secret --name william william
kanidm account radius show_secret --name william william
</code></pre>
<h2 id="account-group-configuration"><a class="header" href="#account-group-configuration">Account group configuration</a></h2>
<p>Kanidm enforces that accounts which can authenticate to RADIUS must be a member
of an allowed group. This allows you to define which users or groups may use
wifi or VPN infrastructure and gives a path for &quot;revoking&quot; access to the resources
through group management. The key point of this is that service accounts should
not be part of this group.</p>
<pre><code>kanidm group create --name idm_admin radius_access_allowed
kanidm group add_members --name idm_admin radius_access_allowed william
</code></pre>
<h2 id="radius-server-service-account"><a class="header" href="#radius-server-service-account">RADIUS Server Service Account</a></h2>
<p>To read these secrets, the RADIUS server requires an account with the
correct privileges. This can be created and assigned through the group
&quot;idm_radius_servers&quot; which is provided by default.</p>
<pre><code>kanidm account create --name admin radius_service_account &quot;Radius Service Account&quot;
kanidm group add_members --name admin idm_radius_servers radius_service_account
kanidm account credential reset_credential --name admin radius_service_account
</code></pre>
<h2 id="deploying-a-radius-container"><a class="header" href="#deploying-a-radius-container">Deploying a RADIUS Container</a></h2>
<p>We provide a RADIUS container that has all the needed integrations. 
This container requires some cryptographic material, laid out in a volume like so:</p>
<pre><code>data
data/ca.pem             # This is the kanidm ca.pem
data/config.ini         # This is the kanidm-radius configuration.
data/certs
data/certs/dh           # openssl dhparam -out ./dh 2048
data/certs/key.pem      # These are the radius ca/cert/key
data/certs/cert.pem
data/certs/ca.pem
</code></pre>
<p>The config.ini has the following template:</p>
<pre><code>[kanidm_client]
url =                   # URL to the kanidm server
strict = false          # Strict CA verification
ca = /data/ca.pem       # Path to the kanidm ca
user =                  # Username of the RADIUS service account
secret =                # Generated secret for the service account

; default VLANs for groups that don't specify one.
[DEFAULT]
vlan = 1

; [group.test]          # group.&lt;name&gt; will have these options applied
; vlan =

[radiusd]
ca =                    # Path to the radius server's CA
key =                   # Path to the radius servers key
cert =                  # Path to the radius servers cert
dh =                    # Path to the radius servers dh params
required_group =        # Name of a kanidm group which you must be 
                        # A member of to use radius.
cache_path =            # A path to an area where cached user records can be stored.
                        # If in doubt, use /dev/shm/kanidmradiusd

; [client.localhost]    # client.&lt;nas name&gt; configures wifi/vpn consumers
; ipaddr =              # ipv4 or ipv6 address of the NAS
; secret =              # Shared secret
</code></pre>
<p>A fully configured example is:</p>
<pre><code>[kanidm_client]
; be sure to check the listening port is correct, it's the docker internal port
; not the external one if these containers are on the same host.
url = https://&lt;kanidmd container name or ip&gt;:8443
strict = true           # Adjust this if you have CA validation issues
ca = /data/ca.crt
user = radius_service_account
secret =                # The generated password from above

; default vlans for groups that don't specify one.
[DEFAULT]
vlan = 1

[group.network_admins]
vlan = 10

[radiusd]
ca = /data/certs/ca.pem
key =  /data/certs/key.pem
cert = /data/certs/cert.pem
dh = /data/certs/dh
required_group = radius_access_allowed
cache_path = /dev/shm/kanidmradiusd

[client.localhost]
ipaddr = 127.0.0.1
secret = testing123

[client.docker]
ipaddr = 172.17.0.0/16
secret = testing123
</code></pre>
<p>You can then run the container with:</p>
<pre><code>docker run --name radiusd -v ...:/data kanidm/radius:latest
</code></pre>
<p>Authentication can be tested through the client.localhost NAS configuration with:</p>
<pre><code>docker exec -i -t radiusd radtest &lt;username&gt; badpassword 127.0.0.1 10 testing123
docker exec -i -t radiusd radtest &lt;username&gt; &lt;radius show_secret value here&gt; 127.0.0.1 10 testing123
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, to expose this to a wifi infrastructure, add your NAS in <code>config.ini</code>:</p>
<pre><code>[client.access_point]
ipaddr = &lt;some ipadd&gt;
secret = &lt;random value&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>And re-create/run your docker instance with <code>-p 1812:1812 -p 1812:1812/udp</code> ...</p>
<p>If you have any issues, check the logs from the radius output they tend to indicate the cause
of the problem. To increase the logging you can re-run your environment with debug enabled:</p>
<pre><code>docker rm radiusd
docker run --name radiusd -e DEBUG=True -i -t -v ...:/data kanidm/radius:latest
</code></pre>
<p>Note the radius container <em>is</em> configured to provide Tunnel-Private-Group-ID so if you wish to use
wifi assigned VLANs on your infrastructure, you can assign these by groups in the config.ini as
shown in the above examples.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="why-tls"><a class="header" href="#why-tls">Why TLS?</a></h1>
<p>You may have noticed that Kanidm requires you to configure TLS in
your container - or that you provide something <em>with</em> TLS in front like haproxy.</p>
<p>This is due to a single setting on the server - <code>secure_cookies</code></p>
<h2 id="what-are-secure-cookies"><a class="header" href="#what-are-secure-cookies">What are Secure Cookies?</a></h2>
<p><code>secure-cookies</code> is a flag set in cookies that &quot;asks&quot; a client to transmit them
back to the origin site if and only if https is present in the URL.</p>
<p>CA verification is <em>not</em> checked - you can use invalid, out of date certificates,
or even certificates where the <code>subjectAltName</code> does not match, but the client
must see https:// as the destination else it <em>will not</em> send the cookies.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-that-affect-kanidm"><a class="header" href="#how-does-that-affect-kanidm">How does that affect Kanidm?</a></h2>
<p>Kanidm's authentication system is a stepped challenge response design, where you
initially request an &quot;intent&quot; to authenticate. Once you establish this intent,
the server sets up a session-id into a cookie, and informs the client of
what authentication methods can proceed.</p>
<p>When you then go to continue the authentication, if you do NOT have a https url,
the cookie with the session-id is not transmitted. The server detects this as
an invalid-state request in the authentication design and immediately disconnects
you from attempting to continue the authentication as you may be using an insecure
channel.</p>
<p>Simply put, we are trying to use settings like secure_cookies to add constraints
to the server so that you <em>must</em> perform and adhere to best practices - such
as having TLS present on your communication channels.</p>

<p>Select an issue (always feel free to reach out to us for advice!), and create a branch to start working:</p>
<pre><code>git branch &lt;feature-branch-name&gt;
git checkout &lt;feature-branch-name&gt;
cargo test
</code></pre>
<p>When you are ready for review (even if the feature isn't complete and you just want some advice)</p>

<p>Once you have the source code, you need certificates to use with the server. I recommend using
let's encrypt, but if this is not possible, please use our insecure cert tool. Without certificates
authentication will fail.</p>
<pre><code>mkdir insecure
cd insecure
../insecure_generate_tls.sh
